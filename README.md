The AnkerApp (or AnchorApp) computes the necessary rode lengths for different wind situations, taking into account the data of your individual setup (boatlength, chainlength, chain diameter, anchorweight) and situation (depth, seabed quality, windspeed). The initial formulas were taken from the Excel sheet created by Alain Fraysse. 

The rodeanch_diagrams program computes a set of diagrams showing necessary rode lengths for different windspeeds and different water depths and some other useful combinations that can be printed out and used when needed.
